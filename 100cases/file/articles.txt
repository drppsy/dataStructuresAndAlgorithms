They say people come to Python for the language, but stay for the community. And itâ€™s true!
The Python community is one of the most supportive and friendly developer communities around. In the spirit of this, we love sharing insights and stories from fellow Pythonistas.
From rockstar coders to unsung heroes, we want to speak to you all. It is our hope that you, reader, will see your name below, too.
If you know someone in the Python community that deserves a spotlight for their amazing work in the community, then get in touch with us via Twitter.
